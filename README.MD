## :information_source: What's this repositorie about?

This repository was created with focus to learn how develop APIRest with NodeJS.<br>
I also did it thinking about getting to know the best libraries, frameworks and databases to work with NodeJS.<br>
I'm looking to create a read.me for each API trying to explain the main content learned but I don't finished it yet.
